<p>I'am Aditya Jain.I'am currently in 10th class and 14 years old.I'am learning how to code from WhiteHatJr (JavaScript).</p>
<p>I wanted to learn how to code because my interest is in creating games instead of playing them and it is really fun to learn how to code.
</p>
<p>My interest in coding built up when I played games like Clash Of Clans and Call Of Duty and really wanted to develop a game myself.</p>
<p>I also like to play Football.I'am a District level football player and also a National level cuber.My best in cubing is not that great but its 14.67 seconds</p>
<p>I Want To Become A Game Developer</p>
